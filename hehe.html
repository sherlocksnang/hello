        <p>A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence. <br>
            Paragraphs are often made up of several sentences. There are usually between three and eight sentences.<br> 
            Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again.</p>
